//Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century. A person is assigned 
//to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in 
//Math.ceil( person.died / 100).

//For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the grouping operation. It should accept as arguments
// an array and a function that computes the group for an element in the array and returns an object that maps 
//group names to arrays of group numbers.

//During the grouping process, keep an object that associates century names (numbers) with arrays of either person
//objects or ages. Since we do not know in advance what categories we will find, weâ€™ll have to create them on the 
//fly. For each person, after computing their century, we test whether that century was already known. If not, add 
//an array for it. Then add the person (or age) to the array for the proper century.
