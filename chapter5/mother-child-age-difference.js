//Using the example data set from this chapter, compute the average age difference between mothers and children 
//(the age of the mother when the child is born). You can use the average function defined earlier in this chapter.
//Note that not all the mothers mentioned in the data are themselves present in the array. The byName object, 
//which makes it easy to find a personâ€™s object from their name, might be useful here.

// age of mother when child born = child born - mother born;
